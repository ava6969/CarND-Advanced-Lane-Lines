**Advanced Lane Finding Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/571/view) Points

### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.  

You're reading it!

### Camera Calibration

#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.

The code for this step is contained in the first code cell of the IPython notebook located in "./examples/example.ipynb" (or in lines # through # of the file called `some_file.py`).  

I start by preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  

I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result:

### Pipeline (single images)

#### 1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.

To demonstrate this step, I will describe how I apply the distortion correction to one of the test images like this one:
![alt text][image2]
I used the code below to undistort the image and convert to gray scale

    undist = cv2.undistort(img, mtx, dist, None, mtx)
    # Convert undistorted image to grayscale
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(undist, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.

I used a combination of color and gradient thresholds to generate a binary image (thresholding steps at lines 81 through 94 in `util.py`).  Here's an example of my output for this step.  (note: this is not actually from one of the test images)

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `warp()`, which appears in lines 97 through 104 in the file `util.py` (output_images/examples/example.py) (or, for example, in the 3rd code cell of the IPython notebook).  The `warp()` function takes as inputs an image (`img`), as well as source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points.  I chose the hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:

```python
src = np.float32([(200,imshape[0]), (600, 450), (700, 450), (1200,imshape[0])])
dst = np.float32([(300,imshape[0]), (300, 0), (1050, 0), (1050,imshape[0])])
```

This resulted in the following source and destination points:

| Source        | Destination   | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| 600, 450      | 300, 0        | 
| 200, 720      | 300, 720      |
| 1200, 720     | 1050, 720      |
| 700, 450      | 1050, 0        |

I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.

#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

Then I did some other stuff and fit my lane lines with a 2nd order polynomial kinda like this:

```python
def fit_poly(img_shape, leftx, lefty, rightx, righty):
     ### TO-DO: Fit a second order polynomial to each with np.polyfit() ###
    left_fit = np.polyfit(lefty, leftx, 2)
    right_fit = np.polyfit(righty, rightx, 2)
    # Generate x and y values for plotting
    ploty = np.linspace(0, img_shape[0]-1, img_shape[0])
    ### TO-DO: Calc both polynomials using ploty, left_fit and right_fit ###
    left_fitx = left_fit[0]*ploty**2 + left_fit[1]*ploty + left_fit[2]
    right_fitx = right_fit[0]*ploty**2 + right_fit[1]*ploty + right_fit[2]
    
    return left_fitx, right_fitx, ploty

def search_around_poly(binary_warped, left_fit, right_fit, margin=100):
    # Grab activated pixels
    nonzero = binary_warped.nonzero()
    nonzeroy = np.array(nonzero[0])
    nonzerox = np.array(nonzero[1])
    
    ### TO-DO: Set the area of search based on activated x-values ###
    ### within the +/- margin of our polynomial function ###
    ### Hint: consider the window areas for the similarly named variables ###
    ### in the previous quiz, but change the windows to our new search area ###
    left_lane_inds = ((nonzerox > (left_fit[0]*(nonzeroy**2) + left_fit[1]*nonzeroy + 
                    left_fit[2] - margin)) & (nonzerox < (left_fit[0]*(nonzeroy**2) + 
                    left_fit[1]*nonzeroy + left_fit[2] + margin)))
    right_lane_inds = ((nonzerox > (right_fit[0]*(nonzeroy**2) + right_fit[1]*nonzeroy + 
                    right_fit[2] - margin)) & (nonzerox < (right_fit[0]*(nonzeroy**2) + 
                    right_fit[1]*nonzeroy + right_fit[2] + margin)))
    
    # Again, extract left and right line pixel positions
    leftx = nonzerox[left_lane_inds]
    lefty = nonzeroy[left_lane_inds] 
    rightx = nonzerox[right_lane_inds]
    righty = nonzeroy[right_lane_inds]

    # Fit new polynomials
    left_fitx, right_fitx, ploty = fit_poly(binary_warped.shape, leftx, lefty, rightx, righty)
    
    ## Visualization ##
    # Create an image to draw on and an image to show the selection window
    out_img = np.dstack((binary_warped, binary_warped, binary_warped))*255
    window_img = np.zeros_like(out_img)
    # Color in left and right line pixels
    out_img[nonzeroy[left_lane_inds], nonzerox[left_lane_inds]] = [255, 0, 0]
    out_img[nonzeroy[right_lane_inds], nonzerox[right_lane_inds]] = [0, 0, 255]

    # Generate a polygon to illustrate the search window area
    # And recast the x and y points into usable format for cv2.fillPoly()
    left_line_window1 = np.array([np.transpose(np.vstack([left_fitx-margin, ploty]))])
    left_line_window2 = np.array([np.flipud(np.transpose(np.vstack([left_fitx+margin, 
                              ploty])))])
    left_line_pts = np.hstack((left_line_window1, left_line_window2))
    right_line_window1 = np.array([np.transpose(np.vstack([right_fitx-margin, ploty]))])
    right_line_window2 = np.array([np.flipud(np.transpose(np.vstack([right_fitx+margin, 
                              ploty])))])
    right_line_pts = np.hstack((right_line_window1, right_line_window2))

    # Draw the lane onto the warped blank image
    cv2.fillPoly(window_img, np.int_([left_line_pts]), (0,255, 0))
    cv2.fillPoly(window_img, np.int_([right_line_pts]), (0,255, 0))
    result = cv2.addWeighted(out_img, 1, window_img, 0.3, 0)
    
    # Plot the polynomial lines onto the image
    ## End visualization steps ##
    
    return result, (left_fitx, right_fitx)
```

#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

I did this in lines 276 through 303 in my code in `util.py`

#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

I implemented this step in lines 305 through 352 in my code in `util.py` in the function `original_lane_lines()`.  Here is an example of my result on a test image:

### Pipeline (video)

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)

---

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.  


I followed the standard lane recognition approcah discussed in the course but i used the magnitude threshold function to get the binary image. Everythign worked as planned. Sometime the lane wasinterpreted wrongly especially when mutliple lanes are drawn on the road. A more robust algorithms would smartly find the right lane closest to the car.
